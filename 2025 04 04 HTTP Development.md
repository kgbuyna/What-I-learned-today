1. In HTTP 1.0 and its prior version , each request need to form TCP connection (handshake), in HTTP 1.1 , the first request to the web server formed persistent connection with the webserver and therefore , subsequent request do not need to form TCP connection. But it has the cost of maintaining those connections while it gets more performant.  
2. In the beginning of the web development , there was only HTML which is linked to other HTML. Over time , it gets more performant and other file emerges css , js , jpg , png etc. If Browser request two image , they send to the webserver in exactly one TCP connection.
3. Data can be cached as specified in the request header. Using etag in header , the client ask the whether its cached file is changed since its last request. Maybe those etag get invalidated if the file is changed.
