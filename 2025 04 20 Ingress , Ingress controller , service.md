Service object operates at OSI level 4 while Ingress at level 7.
	CMD to look up where to the service route the traffic.  
		`kubectl get endpoints chat-server-service`

**Ingress** routes requests based on host/path to the appropriate **service**. It can also handle WebSocket connections, provided the Ingress Controller supports it. A **Service** does not manage protocol-level features like WebSockets â€” it simply forwards traffic to pods.

What the curl cmd does in the following (glad to find it out):
	`curl --resolve "chat.example.com:80:127.0.0.1" -i http://chat.example.com/ping`
--resolve to bypass the DNS on my machine.
It send the request to 127.0.0.1:80 but including ``Host: chat.example.com``. 
Ingress rule look up this ``Host`` header.
